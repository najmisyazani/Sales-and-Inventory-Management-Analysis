## Project Summary
The project aims to develop an end-to-end pipeline for analyzing sales and inventory data, enabling stakeholders to make informed decisions that enhance operational efficiency, profitability, and customer satisfaction. The pipeline will load and transform various sales and inventory datasets into a SQL database, allowing for comprehensive querying to identify trends and patterns, ultimately deriving meaningful insights that drive strategic actions.
